C. Translation

When he came to king Dexamenus for hospitality,
and he deprived his daughter, Deianira, of her virginity,
Hercules wanted to marry her.  When Hercules was away, the centaur Eurytion sought Deianira as his wife. Since her father was fearful of the centaur, he promised that he would give (her). At the specified time, the centaur came with his brothers to the wedding. Hercules interrupted, and killed the centaur, and led away Deianira.
