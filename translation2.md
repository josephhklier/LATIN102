9. William Faulkner’s novel As I lay dying takes its title from an English translation 
of a single word in Odyssey 11.424. In Greek, where participles function very differently 
from English but similarly to Latin, that word is a present active participle. Suggest one 
or more possible translations of Faulkner’s title into Latin.

C. Translate 

Deianira, the wife of Hercules was not able to cross the great river, 
which's name was Evenus, and asked the centaur Nessus, who was the son of 
Ixion and Nephele, for help. 

When Deinira was carried in the river, he wanted to rape her.

To this place, when Hercules had intervened and
when Deianira urged for his protection, he pierced Nessus with his arrows. The
man, as he was dying, when he knew that the arrows of the of the Lernean Hydra, which 
were mostened with posinous liquid, had great strength, gave his blood, which had been taken out, to Deianira and said that it was a love poiton.
